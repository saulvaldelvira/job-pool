//! ```rust,no_run
//! use job_pool::*;
//! use std::thread;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! let conf = PoolConfig::default();
//! let pool = ThreadPool::new(conf).unwrap();
//! for _ in 0..10 {
//!     pool.execute(|| {
//!         thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5));
//!     });
//! }
//! pool.join();
